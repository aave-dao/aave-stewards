# Aave CCTP Bridge

The AaveCctpBridge is a contract to facilitate bridging USDC across chains using Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2. The contract provides a simplified interface for Aave DAO governance to move USDC between supported networks.

## Features

- Bridge USDC from a supported source chain back to the Aave Mainnet Collector via CCTP V2
- Support for both Fast and Standard transfer speeds
- Steward access model (`owner` + `guardian`) for operational execution
- Bridges pull USDC from a pre-configured source `COLLECTOR` (set at deploy time)
- Bridges always send to the Aave Mainnet Collector on the Ethereum domain — the receiver is hardcoded as the `MAINNET_COLLECTOR` constant (sourced from aave-address-book's `AaveV3Ethereum.COLLECTOR`) and cannot be changed

## Transfer Speeds

CCTP V2 supports two transfer speed modes:

| Speed    | Finality Threshold | Description                      |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Fast     | 1000               | Faster transfer, may incur a fee |
| Standard | 2000               | Slower transfer, no fee          |

Essentially, the Fast mode is just a tx confirmation is sufficient while the Standard mode requires hard finality and a large number of mined blocks.
The exact numbers per chain can be found in the Circle documentation:

- [cctp-fast-message-attestation-times](https://developers.circle.com/cctp/required-block-confirmations#cctp-fast-message-attestation-times)
- [cctp-standard-message-attestation-times](https://developers.circle.com/cctp/required-block-confirmations#cctp-standard-message-attestation-times)

The `maxFee` parameter allows specifying the maximum fee (in USDC) willing to pay for Fast transfers.

- For `TransferSpeed.Fast`, `maxFee` is the maximum fee you are willing to pay (in USDC base units).
- For `TransferSpeed.Standard`, fees are `0` (per Iris) so `maxFee` should be set to `0`.

### Querying fees for Fast transfers

Circle exposes the minimum fee rate for a route (in basis points) via Iris. To derive a `maxFee` for `TransferSpeed.Fast`, query:

Example:

```bash
# Arbitrum (3) -> Base (6)
curl -s "https://iris-api.circle.com/v2/burn/USDC/fees/3/6"
```

- Mainnet: `GET https://iris-api.circle.com/v2/burn/USDC/fees/{sourceDomainId}/{destDomainId}`
- Testnet: `GET https://iris-api-sandbox.circle.com/v2/burn/USDC/fees/{sourceDomainId}/{destDomainId}`

The response includes entries for `finalityThreshold` `1000` (Fast / Confirmed) and `2000` (Standard / Finalized).

To derive a `maxFee` for `TransferSpeed.Fast`, use the `minimumFee` where `finalityThreshold == 1000`, then compute (rounding up):

`maxFee = ceil(amount * minimumFee / 10_000)`

**Denomination / decimals**

- Onchain, both `amount` and `maxFee` are expected in the token’s smallest unit (for USDC: `6` decimals, i.e. `1 USDC = 1_000_000` base units).
- The Iris API returns a fee _rate_ (`minimumFee` in bps). This value can be fractional (e.g. `1.3` bps), so do the computation off-chain using decimal math and then round up to base units.

Example (1000 USDC, `minimumFee = 1.3` bps):

- `amountBaseUnits = 1000 * 1_000_000 = 1_000_000_000`
- choose `scale = 10` (one decimal place), so `minimumFeeScaled = 13`
- `maxFeeBaseUnits = ceil(1_000_000_000 * 13 / (10_000 * 10)) = 130_000`
- `130_000` base units = `0.13` USDC

Note: the API returns a fee _rate_ (`minimumFee` in bps), not a precomputed absolute `maxFee`; you derive the absolute value from your `amount`.

## Permissions

The contract implements `OwnableWithGuardian` for permissioned functions.
The owner is expected to be the respective network's Level 1 Executor (Governance), while the guardian provides an operational backup path.

`bridge()` can be called by `owner` or `guardian`. The destination domain and the Mainnet Collector receiver are hardcoded constants — there are no setters.

## Security Considerations

The contract exposes `rescueToken()` and `rescueEth()`, callable by `owner` or `guardian`.
Both rescue methods always transfer assets back to `COLLECTOR` (not arbitrary recipients).

The contract does not expose a `receive()` fallback, so ETH cannot arrive via a plain transfer. `rescueEth()` is retained as a safety net for ETH that arrives via `selfdestruct` or pre-deploy funding.

## CCTP Domain IDs

Domain IDs are defined by Circle's CCTP. The complete list can be found in the [CCTP documentation](https://developers.circle.com/cctp/cctp-supported-blockchains). Only the Ethereum (destination) and source-chain domains are operationally relevant for this steward; the rest of the table below is for reference.

| Network   | Domain ID |
| --------- | --------- |
| Ethereum  | 0         |
| Avalanche | 1         |
| Optimism  | 2         |
| Arbitrum  | 3         |
| Solana    | 5         |
| Base      | 6         |
| Polygon   | 7         |
| Unichain  | 10        |
| Linea     | 11        |
| Sonic     | 13        |
| Monad     | 15        |
| Ink       | 21        |

## Functions

```solidity
function bridge(
  uint256 amount,
  uint256 maxFee,
  TransferSpeed speed
) external onlyOwnerOrGuardian;
```

Bridges USDC to `MAINNET_COLLECTOR` on the Ethereum domain. The bridge contract pulls USDC from the source-chain `COLLECTOR` via `ICollector.transfer`, so the bridge must hold the Collector `FUNDS_ADMIN` role. The destination domain (`DESTINATION_DOMAIN`) and recipient (`MAINNET_COLLECTOR`) are compile-time constants — to change either, the contract source must be modified and redeployed.

Parameters:

- `amount`: Amount of USDC to bridge (must be > 0)
- `maxFee`: Maximum fee in USDC for Fast transfers (must be < `amount`)
- `speed`: `TransferSpeed.Fast` or `TransferSpeed.Standard`

Note: `LOCAL_DOMAIN` is read once at deploy time from Circle's (upgradeable) `TokenMessengerV2` / `MessageTransmitterV2`. If Circle ever migrates those contracts and the local domain changes, this steward must be redeployed.
