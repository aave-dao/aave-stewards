# OFTBridgeSteward

`OFTBridgeSteward` is an Aave Steward that bridges USDT from a non-Ethereum chain to the Ethereum mainnet Collector using USDT0 OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) over LayerZero V2. The transfer is 1:1 with no slippage.

The steward is unidirectional: every deployed instance bridges *to* Ethereum mainnet. The destination endpoint and receiver address are immutable, set in the contract's code (see `DESTINATION_EID` and `MAINNET_COLLECTOR`).

## How USDT0 Works

USDT0 is Tether's official cross-chain solution using LayerZero's OFT standard. It enables unified USDT liquidity across chains without wrapped tokens.

### Architecture

- **On Ethereum (destination):** USDT0 uses `OAdapterUpgradeable` to release native USDT on receipt of a LayerZero message. The steward is **not** deployed on Ethereum.
- **On other chains (source):** USDT0 uses `OUpgradeable` which burns USDT0 on send. The steward is deployed on these chains and calls `send` on the local OFT.

### Key Benefits

- **No Slippage:** 1:1 burn-on-source / release-on-destination mechanism.
- **Unified Liquidity:** All USDT0 is backed 1:1 by USDT locked on Ethereum.
- **Dual DVN Security:** Verified by both the LayerZero DVN and the USDT0 DVN.

## Functions

### `bridge(uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountLD, uint256 maxFee)`

Bridges `amount` USDT to the immutable `MAINNET_COLLECTOR` on Ethereum (`DESTINATION_EID`). Restricted to owner or guardian.

- The steward pulls `amount` USDT from the local Collector via `ICollector.transfer`, so it must hold the Collector `FUNDS_ADMIN` role.
- The native LayerZero fee is paid from the steward's own balance. It can be either pre-funded (use `receive()` or `transfer`) or supplied as `msg.value` on the same call — both add to `address(this).balance`, which is what the contract checks.
- `minAmountLD` is the slippage floor passed through to the OFT.
- `maxFee` caps the LayerZero `nativeFee`. The call reverts with `MaxFeeExceeded` if the quoted fee exceeds it. Always quote the fee first and pass a snug `maxFee` to avoid getting front-run by a fee spike.
- LayerZero refunds any unused fee directly to the local Collector (the refund recipient is set to `COLLECTOR`).

### `quoteSendFee(uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountLD) returns (uint256)`

Returns the native-token fee LayerZero will charge for `bridge(amount, minAmountLD, …)`. Use this to size `maxFee` and the value/balance to fund.

### `quoteAmountReceived(uint256 amount) returns (uint256)`

Returns the amount of USDT the Mainnet Collector will get for an `amount` send (after any OFT-level dust truncation). For USDT0 this equals `amount` (no slippage), but always re-quote on-chain rather than assume.

### `rescueToken(address token)` / `rescueEth()`

Sweeps the steward's full balance of `token` (or ETH) back to the local Collector. Restricted to owner or guardian.

## Usage Pattern

```solidity
// 1. Quote the expected received amount on Ethereum.
uint256 expectedReceived = bridge.quoteAmountReceived(amount);

// 2. Quote the LayerZero native fee.
uint256 fee = bridge.quoteSendFee(amount, expectedReceived);

// 3. Grant the steward FUNDS_ADMIN on the local Collector (one-time).
IAccessControl(address(collector)).grantRole(
    ICollector(address(collector)).FUNDS_ADMIN_ROLE(),
    address(bridge)
);

// 4. Execute the bridge. Either pre-fund the steward with `fee` wei
//    of native, or supply it as msg.value on the same call.
bridge.bridge{value: fee}(amount, expectedReceived, fee);
```

## Permissions

The contract uses `OwnableWithGuardian`. The owner should be the local network's Level 1 Executor (Aave Governance); the guardian is a trusted ops role.

The steward must also hold the local Collector `FUNDS_ADMIN` role so it can call `ICollector.transfer`. Note that this role is broader than what `bridge()` actually exercises — it grants the steward the ability to move *any* token from the Collector to *any* address. A bug or future extension to the steward could in principle exfiltrate other Collector funds, so the role grant is a trust assumption that should be considered when reviewing changes to the steward.

The owner or guardian can:

- Call `bridge()` to initiate transfers.
- Call `rescueToken()` / `rescueEth()` to sweep stuck assets back to the local Collector.

Only the owner can:

- Transfer ownership.

There is no allow-list of receivers: `MAINNET_COLLECTOR` is a constant in the contract's code.

## Security Considerations

- **Slippage protection:** `minAmountLD` enforces the floor for tokens received on Ethereum. Quote `quoteAmountReceived` immediately before sending.
- **Fee protection:** The native fee returned by `quoteSendFee` is a *quote* and can drift between the off-chain quote and on-chain execution — LayerZero's executor uses oracle price feeds for destination gas that refresh periodically (typically on the order of minutes), and DVN fees can also shift. The steward re-quotes inside `bridge` immediately before `IOFT.send` and pays whatever the live fee is, drawing from its own balance. `maxFee` is the caller-supplied ceiling: if the live fee exceeds it the call reverts with `MaxFeeExceeded`, so the steward can never be drained beyond `maxFee` per call. Operational guidance: size `maxFee` as `quoteSendFee * (1 + buffer)` (e.g. `1.1x`); if a call reverts with `MaxFeeExceeded`, re-quote and retry.
- **Approval hygiene:** The steward `forceApprove`s the OFT for exactly `amount`, then resets to `0` after `send`, so no allowance is left dangling.
- **Refund routing:** LayerZero's refund recipient is hard-coded to the local `COLLECTOR`, so excess native fee goes back to Aave directly.
- **Rescue path:** Inherits `RescuableBase`; `maxRescue` returns the steward's full token balance, allowing complete sweep.
- **Fixed destination/receiver:** `DESTINATION_EID` (Ethereum mainnet) and `MAINNET_COLLECTOR` are constants, removing destination-spoofing surface.

## Retry Mechanism

LayerZero supports retrying messages that fail to execute on the destination chain. Because verification (DVN attestation) is decoupled from execution, an already-verified message can be re-executed by anyone without resending it from the source chain.

### How to Retry

1. **LayerZero Scan UI:** find the failed message at [layerzeroscan.com](https://layerzeroscan.com/) and trigger a retry.
2. **Direct call:** invoke `lzReceive` on the destination Endpoint contract.

See the [LayerZero debugging documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/troubleshooting/debugging-messages#retry-message) for details.

### Not Supported

| Chain     | Reason              |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Avalanche | No USDT0 deployment |
| Base      | No USDT0 deployment |

## Known Limitations

1. **Destination is fixed to Ethereum mainnet.** A new contract deployment is required to bridge to any other chain.
2. **USDT0 only.** Only USDT transfers within the USDT0 system are supported.
3. **LayerZero native fee.** A small native-token fee is required for messaging. Quote it with `quoteSendFee` before each call. The quote can drift between off-chain quote-time and on-chain execution; see **Fee protection** above for how `maxFee` bounds the exposure.
