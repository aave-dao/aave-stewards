# Aave Arbitrum -> Mainnet ERC20 Bridge Steward

Bridging funds from the Arbitrum Collector to Ethereum mainnet currently requires a governance proposal. This Steward delegates that responsibility to a Guardian, consistent with the approach taken on Polygon and Optimism.

Adapted from the existing [AaveArbEthERC20Bridge](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0335ffa9af5ce05590d6c9a75b645470e07744a9) (`0x0335ffa9af5ce05590d6c9a75b645470e07744a9`) to include a Steward Role so the AFC (guardian) can bridge funds without requiring an AIP submission each time.

The official Arbitrum documentation can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20).

## Security Considerations

Not all ERC20 tokens on Arbitrum are compatible with the standard gateway. Each token uses a specific L2 gateway for bridging. Governance must only allowlist tokens that can be bridged via their respective gateways. Tokens that rely on custom bridges or external protocols must **NOT** be added to the token mapping:

- **Native USDC**: Bridged via Circle's CCTP, not through the standard gateway.
- **wstETH**: Uses a custom bridge maintained by Lido.

## Functions

`function bridge(address token, uint256 amount) external`

Callable by owner or guardian. Pulls `amount` of `token` from the Arbitrum Collector, then bridges to the Mainnet Collector via the token's configured L2 gateway. The token must have a valid config set via `setTokenMapping`.

`function setTokenMapping(address l2Token, address l1Token, address gateway) external`

Callable by owner only (governance). Sets the L1 token address and L2 gateway corresponding to an L2 token.

**Only tokens that have been mapped can be bridged.** The mapping starts empty; governance must explicitly allow each token.

`function removeTokenMapping(address l2Token) external`

Callable by owner only (governance). Removes a token mapping, disabling bridging for that token.

`function rescueToken(address token) external`

Callable by owner or guardian. Rescues ERC20 tokens stuck in the contract back to the Arbitrum Collector.

`function nonce() external view returns (uint256)`

Returns the current bridge nonce. Each bridge operation increments the nonce.

## Finalizing the Bridge

After calling `bridge()` on Arbitrum, it takes ~7 days for the withdrawal to be available (optimistic rollup). Once available, the withdrawal can be finalized on Mainnet.

A burn proof is generated via the `aave-cli` tool, which can be found [here](https://github.com/TokenLogic-com-au/aave-cli-tools).

The command to generate the proof is:

`yarn start arbitrum-bridge-exit <TX_HASH> <INDEX> <ARBITRUM_BLOCK_OF_TX>`

Where `TX_HASH` is the hash of the bridge transaction on Arbitrum, `INDEX` is the withdrawal index (if there are 3 tokens bridged in the same transaction, the indexes will be 0, 1 and 2), and `ARBITRUM_BLOCK_OF_TX` is the block the bridge transaction happened at.
